      	<span style="color: seagreen;">Nature</span>, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material <span style="color: seagreen;">world</span>or universe. <span style="color: seagreen;">"Nature"</span> can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of <span style="color: seagreen;">nature</span> is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of <span style="color: seagreen;">nature</span>, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other <span style="color: seagreen;">natural</span> phenomena.The word <span style="color: seagreen;">nature</span>is borrowed from the Old <span style="color: seagreen;">French</span> nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or <span style="color: seagreen;">"essential qualities, innate disposition"</span>, and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".
